Today I got the following SMS from one of the local movie theaters:

![Formula kino SMS][sms]

I'm not going to renew this subscription because I haven't visited this theater in months.

Also, it has been sent at 7AM. I mean, why can't they send it later? I wake up in 8AM. I would have been woken up by this useless message if it weren't for silent mode I use on my iPhone constantly. Another reason to let them go without me.
