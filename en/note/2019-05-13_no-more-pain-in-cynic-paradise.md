Recently I reported that [Yandex.Music has replaced one version][replacement] of Pain's "Cynic Paradise" album with another one. I was angry at the time.

Today I found out there's no "Cynic Paradise" album at all, the album has been completely removed. Now three singles replace it. And I'm no longer angry. Thank God we have local files.
