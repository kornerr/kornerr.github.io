This is the first entry in my personal site / diary. I've been wanting
to do my personal site for quite some time now. However, I was never quite
enjoying Wordpress, Jekyll and other systems because of their complexity.
Just as any normal programmer, I wanted to do my own system. While
I type these words, the system is in its infancy, however, it already
powers [Opensource Game Studio][ogs] site. And I like that system very much.
It's not yet ready to produce personal site, however, I decided to start
writing Markdown files for it in advance just because I could not hold my
emotions any more.

What's the fuss, you ask? Digital feudalism, damn it! It's driving me nuts. Read
the [next note][pain-cynic-paradise] to find out more.
