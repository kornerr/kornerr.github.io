I participate in Soft Skills Plus program held by EPAM in early 2019.

Time management module started off with a great quote:

```
Don't say you don't have enough time. You have exactly the same number of hours per day that were given to Helen Keller, Pasteur, Michelangelo, Mother Theresa, Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson, and Albert Einstein.
```
-- Jackson Brown
