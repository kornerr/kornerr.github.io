Lately I wrote about how we at Opensource Game Studio are going to [defend availability][defense] of our tools from so-called "dead hand
of a business".

I have also read a few articles about the ongoing installation of so-called "Digital feudalism" that is happening nowadays (2019):

These articles increase my concerns about the inequity of data ownership. You may very well argue that it's how things always worked in the world: there were always the rich and the poor. And I agree with you on that one.

However, when the digital feudalism stroke me today, I became very angry. I've been using Yandex.Music for quite some time now because Yandex.Music allows me to listen to music for free. I've been listening to [Pain albums][yandex-music-pain] for more than a few months when I code at work to keep myself isolated from the office noise.

And today I found out that one of the Pain's albums - Cynic Paradise - has been removed. As of today, Yandex.Music has a different version of Cynic Paradise album that misses a few tracks I fell in love with:

* Here is the news
* Clouds of ecstasy

Now, you can probably imagine how angry I was when I was hit by Yandex Landlord. Looks like I'll be going back to the "download era" to keep myself out of surprises like that. Sure, you can say I "lose" suggestions from Yandex Landlord. But I'm ready for it. I want to listen to the music without interruptions or decisions from third parties.
