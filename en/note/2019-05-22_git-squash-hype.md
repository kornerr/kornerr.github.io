I've got an email from Atlassian today:

apparantly Git users use squash to liberate their history from noise

mercurial has it much easier by default: simply merge the necessary branch's commit into `default`, and that's it: `default` only gets a complete difference between `default` and the branch you merge as a single commit in `default`. If you want details simply see the branch, if you don't want the noise, simply see `default`.
