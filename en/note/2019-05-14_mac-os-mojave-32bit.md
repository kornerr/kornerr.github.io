Today I've updated Xcode to 10.2.1 on macOS Mojave. When I launched iPhone5 Simulator, I was presented with a message that told me the Simulator is an outdated 32-bit dirt. "Learn More..." button led to this page: [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208436][32bit]

The page's most important part is this:

```
At our Worldwide Developers Conference in 2018, Apple informed developers that macOS Mojave is the last version of macOS to run 32-bit apps.
```

Damn feudals.
